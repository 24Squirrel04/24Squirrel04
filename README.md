This is a quote from my favorite movie [The Martian](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)). Further in the development of all projects it will be assumed that I was guided by this quote for each project.

> At some point, everything's gonna go south on you...  
> everything's going to go south and you're going to say,  
> this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept  
> that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin.  
> You do the math. You solve one problem... and you solve the  
> next one... and then the next. And If you solve enough  
> problems, you get to come home. All right, questions?

## Public

At the moment, there is only 1 project in public repositories:

- [E32_433t30d_Data_transmission](https://github.com/24Squirrel04/E32_433t30d_Data_transmission.git) - This project is not related to the work of its author! And published for educational purposes only. Because This project does not contain a large number of files and does not relate to the development of any service. There may be both a discrepancy with PEP8 and a lack of use of basic development practices.
